// How to practice a language !

// Here are some exercises to help you improving your skills in any programming language.
// The purpose of this exercise sheet is to allow anybody learning a new language to practise. Exercises are ordered by difficulty.
// The exercises are taken from practical session of EPITA's first year.
// Document will be updated with new exercises and corrections are available for some languages.
// Since I am far from knowing every programming language, some exercise may not be as easy as they could be.
// Feel free to send me corrections for languages that are not available yet,
// new exercises ideas or any mistakes that I could have made !
// Nothing will be clearly explained, you will just have exercises and corrections.
// You need to look for answers on the internet (stackoverflow.com is good for example) and search by yourself.
// Tutorials are available all around the internet, but searching by yourself helps you learning about things
// you were not looking for !
// Good luck :)

// Create a new project for the language you want to learn and add this file with the 
// right extension (.c for c, .cpp for C++, .cs for C#, etc.) regarding the language.
// You will need to add the corresponding headers/library/etc.

// Advance Question:
// These are question from actual interview with large companies.

// Microsoft Interview Question: 
// Write a Function to Reverse the word order of String 
// Sample: "This is a Cat" -> "Cat a is This" 

// Facebook Interview Question:
// Write a Function which proves if a String is a Palindrome 
// Note: Word which is read the same Backward as Forward 

// Facebook Interview Question:
// Given a List of Arrays, write a Function which will  
// Return True if Two of the Number equal 12 

// Microsoft Interview Question: 
// With a given Array  (Multidimensional Array) find location 
// Zero & Replaces all Columns & Rows with Zero 
// Sample:  
// Input:{  1,  2,  3,  4 } 
//    	  {  5,  6,  7,  8 } 
//       {  9, 10,  0, 11 } 
//       { 12, 13, 14, 15 } 

// Output: {  1,  2,  0,  4 } 
//         {  5,  6,  0,  8 } 
//         {  0,  0,  0,  0 } 
//         { 12, 13,  0, 15 }
