--  How to practice a language !

--  Here are some exercises to help you improving your skills in any programming language.
--  The purpose of this exercise sheet is to allow anybody learning a new language to practise. Exercises are ordered by difficulty.
--  The exercises are taken from practical session of EPITA's first year.
--  Document will be updated with new exercises and corrections are available for some languages.
--  Since I am far from knowing every programming language, some exercise may not be as easy as they could be.
--  Feel free to send me corrections for languages that are not available yet,
--  new exercises ideas or any mistakes that I could have made !
--  Nothing will be clearly explained, you will just have exercises and corrections.
--  You need to look for answers on the internet (stackoverflow.com is good for example) and search by yourself.
--  Tutorials are available all around the internet, but searching by yourself helps you learning about things
--  you were not looking for !
--  Good luck :)

--  Create a new project for the language you want to learn and add this file with the 
--  right extension (.c for c, .cpp for C++, .cs for C#, etc.) regarding the language.
--  You will need to add the corresponding headers/library/etc.



-- Part One:


-- FIXME: Declare variables
-- Declare two variables: an integer named "age", and a string named "name" with corresponding values (your name and age)

-- FIXME: Print
-- Print the following sentence in the console "You are NAME and you are AGE years old !". Don't forget to add a newline at the end

-- FiXME: Concatenation
-- Create a new string variable called "hello" which value is "Hello ". Add "name" at the end of "hello" (Concatenation) then print it

-- FIXME: Array
-- create a new string array called "shoppingList", with three elements of your choice. Create an int variable containing the number of
-- elements in "shoppingList" (using a function of the array/using the array)

-- FIXME: For-loop - Integer
-- Create a simple for-loop for an integer "i" going from 1 to 10 that print the value of "i"

-- FIXME: For-loop - shoppingList
-- Create a for loop that iterate through "shoppingList" and prints each element.

-- FIXME: Foreach-loop
-- Do the same with a foreach-loop.

-- FIXME: If-statement
-- Modify the first for-loop (with i from 1 to 10) such that it prints "(value of i) is even" when "i" is divisible
-- by 2 (You may want to learn more about "modulo" (%)). Else, print "(value of i) is odd".

-- FIXME: Sum Up
-- Create a string variable called "element" with the value of your choice. Then create a for-loop that checks if "shoppingList" contains 
-- "element". If yes, print "You have to buy (value of element) !", and stop the loop (search how to stop a loop).
-- If not, print "Nope, you don't need (value of "element")".





-- Part Two:


-- FIXME: Functions - Ascii
-- Create a function that returns nothing and which doesn't takes any parameter. It should just be named "TriForce"
-- and print the TriForce symbol (one triangle over two other ones, can be found on internet) with "TRIFORCE"
-- Don't forget to call the function !


-- FIXME: Functions - One parameter
-- Create a function that takes a string as parameter and returns "Hello (value of string) !"

-- FIXME: Functions - Multiple parameters
-- Create a function that takes two integers as parameters and returns the addition of these two.
-- You can do the same with multiplication, subtraction and division.

-- FIXME: User entry
-- Create a string variable that takes what the user enter in the console as value. Then print "You entered (value of string)"

-- FIXME: While loop
-- Create a while loop that takes a number and divides it by 2 until it is less than 3

-- FIXME: do-While loop
-- Do the same with a do-while loop

-- FIXME: Random generator
-- Create a function that returns a random number

-- FIXME: Random generator with bounds
-- Create another function that returns a random number between two bounds given as parameters.

-- FIXME: Multidimensional array
-- Create a two dimensional int array of 3 columns and 3 rows. Use 2 for-loops to add a random number
-- between 1 and 9 in each of the 9 rooms.
-- You may use one of the two previously created function.
-- Then print them such that they appear like this (with [x1,x9] being the 9 random integers):
-- {x1,x2,x3,}
-- {x4,x5,x6,}
-- {x7,x8,x9,}


-- FIXME: Switch
-- Create a Switch that takes an integer "a" and return a sentence regarding the value of a
-- (Create 3 statements for 3 specific values and a default one)

-- FIXME: logic Gates
-- Create 7 functions for each logic gates (And, Or, No, Nand, Nor, Xnor, Xor).
-- Each function takes two booleans as parameters and returns the result of the logic gate.
-- (or You can do it with a switch and only one function)

-- FIXME - Reverse
-- Create a function that reverse a string
