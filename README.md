How to learn a language
=======================

###What is it ?
How to practice a language !

Here are some exercises to help you improve your skills in any programming language.
The purpose of this project (and Exercises) is to allow anybody learning a new language to practice.
Exercises are ordered by difficulty.

The exercises are taken from practical session from my first year.
Document will be updated with new exercises and corrections are available for some languages.
Since I am far from knowing every programming language, some exercise may not be as easy as they could be.
Feel free to send me corrections for languages that are not available yet,
new exercises ideas or any mistakes that I could have made !

Nothing will be clearly explained, you will just have exercises and corrections.
You need to look for answers on the internet (stackoverflow.com is a good start for example) and search by yourself.
Tutorials are available all around the internet, but searching by yourself helps you learn about things
you were not looking for !


Good luck :)

Create a new project for the language you want to learn and add the correct correction file with the
right extension (.c for c, .cpp for C++, .cs for C#, etc.) regarding the language.
You will need to add the corresponding headers/library/etc.

###Notes
- The Swift correction was created at the time where XCode was in version 6b5. The language has evolved since and thus the correction may not be 100% accurate.

###Disclaimer
These exercises and corrections are not here to teach how to code in a clean way.
They are just here to teach the fundamentals of programming in different languages, and thus different syntaxes.
Code factorisation, splitting into different files, or coding style for example are not resepcted due to the fact that they are not the goal here and would decrease readability (especially splitting into files).
They are to be used as cheat sheets with quick access, not example of perfect code (thanksfully).  
Thank you
